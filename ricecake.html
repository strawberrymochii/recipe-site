        <p>
            Notes:<br>
            - Both fresh and frozen rice cakes can be used, but frozen rice cakes need to be thawed in warm water first <br>
            - If the rice cake is uncut, slice the log into 1/4 inch ovals <br>
            - Bok choy sprouts can be substituted with other leafy vegetables. I like using napa cabbage!

            </h2>
    <p>
        - Rice cakes <br>
        - Shanghai bok choy sprouts <br>
        - Ground or chopped pork <br>
        - Soy sauce <br>

        Instructions:
    </h2>
    <ul>
    1. Wash the bok choy sprouts, then cut into smaller pieces
    <br>
    2. Warm a pan with oil over high heat, then add in the pork and cook until brown
    <br>
    3. Add in the bok choy and stir fry until wilted
    <br>
    4. Push the vegetables and pork in the center of the pan, then add the rice cakes on top of the pile. This prevents the rice cakes from sticking to the pand.
    <br>
    5. Pour in half a cup of water and cover the pan. Let the rice cakes steam for 2-3 minutes, or until they are soft. You may have to add more water if it evaporates too quickly.
    <br>
    6. Remove lid and pour in soy sauce, then stir fry everything together until the rice cakes are completely coated in sauce.
