recipe-site is a website where I save and share some of my favourite recipes! I wanted somewhere to write down and collect recipes for my favourite home-cooked foods so that I could make them on my own in the future. This project was also done to learn and practice HTML and CSS, the two languages I used to make this site. 

Since this was my first time both coding a website, I had to learn basic HTML/CSS (mostly from W3Schools), and figure out how to use them together. I also learned how to do animations in CSS by following different tutorials online. I definitely struggled at first with understanding flexboxes and grids, particularly with trying to get an evenly spaced and centered layout, and it took many tiny adjustments before it looked right. I also had some problems with making the website responsive, so that it wouldn't look distorted on different sized screens, but I eventually got it figured out after many google searches.
